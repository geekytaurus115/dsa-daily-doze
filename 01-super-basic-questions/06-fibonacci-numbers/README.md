### Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms.


## Fibonacci Number Definition

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two.


The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as follows:

- Base case:
  - \( F(0) = 0 \)
  - \( F(1) = 1 \)

- Recursive case:
  - For \( n > 1 \):
    - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)

The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
